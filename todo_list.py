# Project: Simple To-Do List Application

# Outline:
# 1. Create a menu-driven console application
# 2. Implement the following features:
#    a. Add a task
#    b. View all tasks
#    c. Mark a task as complete
#    d. Remove a task
#    e. Quit the application
# 3. Use a list to store tasks
# 4. Each task should be a dictionary containing:
#    - Task description
#    - Completion status (True/False)
# 5. Implement input validation where necessary
# 6. Use functions to organize your code

# This project will help you practice:
# - Working with lists and dictionaries
# - Creating and calling functions
# - Implementing a simple menu system
# - Basic input/output operations
# - Control structures (if/else, loops)

# To get started, try implementing the menu system and the "Add a task" feature.
